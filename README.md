# SampleFinchProject
Basic skeleton for a locally hosted webpage to control the Finch bot.

Includes a Frontend folder with a singular page (index.html), a Backend folder with the BirdBrain Python library for Mac as well as a "meow.py" first script to test out. The "app.py" is the script that runs the website and connects the frontend and the backend. It is intentionally left as a template to be filled out in class.

Make sure you install the BirdBrain Python library for another operating system if you don't use Mac, as well as installing Flask.
